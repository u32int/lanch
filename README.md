## lanch
lanch is an application launcher written in rust using the iced ui toolkit.

#### Goals
    - Usability first
    - Reasonable performance
    - Simple, modern look by default
    - Modular: it's easy to write your own modules for the search "API" (implementing a rust trait really)
    - Themeable

###### lanch is not a dmenu replacement
lanch does not try to be a versatile tool that you can pipe stuff into like dmenu. 

lanch is **primarly an application launcher** and internal design decisions reflect that. 
It is not a window switcher or a clock with app launching capabilities. It's the other way around :)

##### Contributing
I will be happy to accept contributions that align with the project goals.
Please open an issue first if the changes are big enough.
